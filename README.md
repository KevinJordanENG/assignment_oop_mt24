# Agricola - Implementation for OOP MT24

This file contains listed and described features of the implementation such as advanced type features, object oriented patterns, and reusable data structures. A short notes section addressing limitations, assumptions, and implementation choices is also included.

## Advanced Type Features

{list only}

## Object Oriented Patterns

{list, explain where, justify}

1. Facade Pattern - Implemented in the 'Game' class, the entry point for this single entry point / API style package. All complexities and submodules/subclasses/data structures are hidden from the user/client yet all functionality are accessible.

## Reusable Data Structures

{list, explain where, justify}

## Notes

- Age checking for players was omitted as it was considered that playing an API based game implied age of at least 12 years.
- "side_job" and other 2 variant tiles are not used in base game, and therefore omitted.
- 3 yellow "suggestion" tiles are only intended as support for extra young/inexperienced players so were omitted.
